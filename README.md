[//]: # (FunASR supports pre-trained or further fine-tuned models for deployment as a service. The CPU version of the Chinese offline file conversion service has been released, details can be found in [docs]&#40;funasr/runtime/docs/SDK_tutorial.md&#41;. More detailed information about service deployment can be found in the [deployment roadmap]&#40;funasr/runtime/readme_cn.md&#41;.)


<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

Below is a quick start tutorial. Test audio files ([Mandarin](https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ASR/test_audio/vad_example.wav), [English](https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ASR/test_audio/asr_example_en.wav)).

### Command-line usage

```shell
funasr ++model=paraformer-zh ++vad_model="fsmn-vad" ++punc_model="ct-punc" ++input=asr_example_zh.wav
```

Notes: Support recognition of single audio file, as well as file list in Kaldi-style wav.scp format: `wav_id wav_pat`

### Speech Recognition (Non-streaming)
#### SenseVoice
```python
from funasr import AutoModel
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model_dir = "iic/SenseVoiceSmall"

model = AutoModel(
    model=model_dir,
    vad_model="fsmn-vad",
    vad_kwargs={"max_single_segment_time": 30000},
    device="cuda:0",
)

# en
res = model.generate(
    input=f"{model.model_path}/example/en.mp3",
    cache={},
    language="auto",  # "zn", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=True,
    batch_size_s=60,
    merge_vad=True,  #
    merge_length_s=15,
)
text = rich_transcription_postprocess(res[0]["text"])
print(text)
```
Parameter Description:
- `model_dir`: The name of the model, or the path to the model on the local disk.
- `vad_model`: This indicates the activation of VAD (Voice Activity Detection). The purpose of VAD is to split long audio into shorter clips. In this case, the inference time includes both VAD and SenseVoice total consumption, and represents the end-to-end latency. If you wish to test the SenseVoice model's inference time separately, the VAD model can be disabled.
- `vad_kwargs`: Specifies the configurations for the VAD model. `max_single_segment_time`: denotes the maximum duration for audio segmentation by the `vad_model`, with the unit being milliseconds (ms).
- `use_itn`: Whether the output result includes punctuation and inverse text normalization.
- `batch_size_s`: Indicates the use of dynamic batching, where the total duration of audio in the batch is measured in seconds (s).
- `merge_vad`: Whether to merge short audio fragments segmented by the VAD model, with the merged length being `merge_length_s`, in seconds (s).
- `ban_emo_unk`: Whether to ban the output of the `emo_unk` token.

#### Paraformer
```python
from funasr import AutoModel
# paraformer-zh is a multi-functional asr model
# use vad, punc, spk or not as you need
model = AutoModel(model="paraformer-zh",  vad_model="fsmn-vad",  punc_model="ct-punc", 
                  # spk_model="cam++", 
                  )
res = model.generate(input=f"{model.model_path}/example/asr_example.wav", 
                     batch_size_s=300, 
                     hotword='È≠îÊê≠')
print(res)
```
Note: `hub`: represents the model repository, `ms` stands for selecting ModelScope download, `hf` stands for selecting Huggingface download.

### Speech Recognition (Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

chunk_size = [0, 10, 5] #[0, 10, 5] 600ms, [0, 8, 4] 480ms
encoder_chunk_look_back = 4 #number of chunks to lookback for encoder self-attention
decoder_chunk_look_back = 1 #number of encoder chunks to lookback for decoder cross-attention

model = AutoModel(model="paraformer-zh-streaming")

import soundfile
import os

wav_file = os.path.join(model.model_path, "example/asr_example.wav")
speech, sample_rate = soundfile.read(wav_file)
chunk_stride = chunk_size[1] * 960 # 600ms

cache = {}
total_chunk_num = int(len((speech)-1)/chunk_stride+1)
for i in range(total_chunk_num):
    speech_chunk = speech[i*chunk_stride:(i+1)*chunk_stride]
    is_final = i == total_chunk_num - 1
    res = model.generate(input=speech_chunk, cache=cache, is_final=is_final, chunk_size=chunk_size, encoder_chunk_look_back=encoder_chunk_look_back, decoder_chunk_look_back=decoder_chunk_look_back)
    print(res)
```
Note: `chunk_size` is the configuration for streaming latency.` [0,10,5]` indicates that the real-time display granularity is `10*60=600ms`, and the lookahead information is `5*60=300ms`. Each inference input is `600ms` (sample points are `16000*0.6=960`), and the output is the corresponding text. For the last speech segment input, `is_final=True` needs to be set to force the output of the last word.

### Voice Activity Detection (Non-Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="fsmn-vad")
wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/vad_example.wav"
res = model.generate(input=wav_file)
print(res)
```
Note: The output format of the VAD model is: `[[beg1, end1], [beg2, end2], ..., [begN, endN]]`, where `begN/endN` indicates the starting/ending point of the `N-th` valid audio segment, measured in milliseconds.

### Voice Activity Detection (Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

chunk_size = 200 # ms
model = AutoModel(model="fsmn-vad")

import soundfile

wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/vad_example.wav"
speech, sample_rate = soundfile.read(wav_file)
chunk_stride = int(chunk_size * sample_rate / 1000)

cache = {}
total_chunk_num = int(len((speech)-1)/chunk_stride+1)
for i in range(total_chunk_num):
    speech_chunk = speech[i*chunk_stride:(i+1)*chunk_stride]
    is_final = i == total_chunk_num - 1
    res = model.generate(input=speech_chunk, cache=cache, is_final=is_final, chunk_size=chunk_size)
    if len(res[0]["value"]):
        print(res)
```
Note: The output format for the streaming VAD model can be one of four scenarios:
- `[[beg1, end1], [beg2, end2], .., [begN, endN]]`ÔºöThe same as the offline VAD output result mentioned above.
- `[[beg, -1]]`ÔºöIndicates that only a starting point has been detected.
- `[[-1, end]]`ÔºöIndicates that only an ending point has been detected.
- `[]`ÔºöIndicates that neither a starting point nor an ending point has been detected. 

The output is measured in milliseconds and represents the absolute time from the starting point.
### Punctuation Restoration
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="ct-punc")
res = model.generate(input="ÈÇ£‰ªäÂ§©ÁöÑ‰ºöÂ∞±Âà∞ËøôÈáåÂêß happy new year ÊòéÂπ¥ËßÅ")
print(res)
```
### Timestamp Prediction
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="fa-zh")
wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/asr_example.wav"
text_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/text.txt"
res = model.generate(input=(wav_file, text_file), data_type=("sound", "text"))
print(res)
```


### Speech Emotion Recognition
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="emotion2vec_plus_large")

wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/test.wav"

res = model.generate(wav_file, output_dir="./outputs", granularity="utterance", extract_embedding=False)
print(res)
```
